# professional-portfolio


## Description

In this assignment, I got hands-on experience with creating a webpage. I created a professional portfolio webpage entirely from scratch. The first step, was to get the initial and basic design down. After that, I worked on the navbar. The navbar allowed me to create the sections that I would use for this project. The main section is the "work" section. Here I added images to display the profile's work. The other sections included contact info, resume, about me, and profile picture. In this assignment, I was able to test my knowledge of html and css skills. I also learned some new techniques through my own research for this assignment. I have listed some of the topics/features in the Features section below.
